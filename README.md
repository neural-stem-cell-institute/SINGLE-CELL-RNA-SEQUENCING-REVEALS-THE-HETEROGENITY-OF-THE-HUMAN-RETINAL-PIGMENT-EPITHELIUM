The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) supports the neural retina and the light response. RPE dysfunction leads to vision loss, as in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). While it has been considered a largely homogenous monolayer, differences in morphology, gene expression and function of RPE cells in different parts of the eye cup imply RPE cell diversity. Moreover, the RPE layer includes a highly proliferative subpopulation of cells, the RPE stem cells (RPESCs), that are not yet prospectively identified. To define native RPE cell subtypes, we directly isolated RPE cells from donated human cadaver eyes, and applied two single cell RNA sequencing technologies to enable both breadth and depth of transcriptome analysis. We define 13 subclusters, demonstrating significant heterogeneity, one with the unique gene expression expected from the RPESC, confirmed by immunostaining. Defining the RPESC and the diversity of RPE cells broadens our understanding of retinal function and potential for RPE repair.
